# BasicDataGrid

## Overview
BasicDataGrid is a custom control for model-driven apps in Dataverse. It provides a simple data grid that replaces most of the out-of-the-box grid functionality. This control serves as a starting point for developers who need to create custom grids that extend the platform's capabilities. It does not provide any new functionality not already present in Dataverse grids; it is only intended as a jumpstart to customizations where developers would otherwise need to meet this baseline before beginning their desired customizations.

## Features
- Reproduces most of the out-of-the-box grid functionality
- Provides a baseline for customization and extension
- Supports scenarios where developers need to write custom grids to meet user functional needs

## Limitations
- Does not yet support Reflow
- Does not provide column filtering

## Installation
To use BasicDataGrid in your model-driven app, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Customize the grid to your specific requirements.
3. Import the control into your Dataverse environment.
4. Add the control to your app's form or view.

## Usage
Once the control is added to your app, you can configure it to meet your specific requirements. Refer to Dataverse PCF API documentation for more information on how to cusotmize this baseline.
